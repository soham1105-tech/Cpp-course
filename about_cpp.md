### C++ Language: Explanation & Short History  

### What is C++?  
C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that supports:  
- Procedural programming (like C)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Generic programming (templates)  
- Low-level memory manipulation (pointers, manual memory management)  

### It is widely used in:  
✔ Game development (Unreal Engine)  
✔ Operating systems (Windows, Linux kernels)  
✔ Embedded systems  
✔ High-frequency trading  
✔ Browsers (Chrome, Firefox)

### Short History of C++  
1. 1979: Bjarne Stroustrup (Bell Labs) starts enhancing C to support OOP.  
2. 1983: Renamed "C++" (++ means increment in C).  
3. 1985: First commercial release (Cfront compiler).  
4. 1998: First standardized (C++98) by ISO.  
5. 2011: Major update (C++11) with modern features (auto, lambdas, smart pointers).  
6. 2020: C++20 introduces modules, concepts, and coroutines.  

C++ remains one of the fastest languages, balancing high-level abstractions and low-level control.
